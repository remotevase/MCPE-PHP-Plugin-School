<h2>General PHP Knowledge: Volume A</h2>
<p><strong>Lesson 1: Using "switch" statements</strong></p>
<p> Some devs like @Blabla wanted to know how to use the switch() statements properly!
So I decided to post a tutorial on it! Special thanks to @Blabla

To Start Of: What is a Switch() statement and what does it do?

1) A switch statement is a really organized statement that's better than a If statement to focus on a certain property or variable and cases of them!
Recalling If Statements

GENERAL Example: </p>

<code>if($number == 1){
   echo "Hi #1";
}else{
   if($number == 2){
      echo "whats Up #2?";
}
</code>
<p> However with a switch statement: </p>
<code>
switch($number){

   case 1:
   echo "Hi #1";
   break;

   case 2:
   echo "Whats Up #2?";
   break;

   default:
   echo "never heard of it";
   break;
}</code>

<p> Analyzing Parts of a Switch!

case:
The Case statement is similar to "==" in a If statement as the code executes as if the number chosen was 1.

break:
Similar to the closing bracket of an If statement, break ends the current case.

default:
This means if the parameter was not part of the case system like for example, in this general example above, any number thats NOT 1 or 2 gets that message

Using it In ImagicalMine API
Assuming you know how to code after reading those tutorials of mine:
How does it work in the API?

Recalling that Most Plugins Use Strings for the cases, and the example above was for int abbreviated for integer.

For strings it would be: </p>
<code>switch(strtolower($string)){
   case "Hello":
   echo "Hello World";
   break;
} </code>
<p> Notice how the case parameter is quoted as it represents a string case.

Similarly in API:
People use the switch statement for commands usually:
Lets take a look! </p>
<code>public function onCommand(CommandSender $sender, Command $cmd, $label, array $args){
   switch(strtolower($cmd->getName()){
      case "cg":
      $sender->setGameMode(1);
      break;

      case "sg":
      $sender->setGameMode(0);
      break;
   }
return true;
}</code>
<p> So in Conclusion: Switch statements are good for organization and is most;y used in onCommand().
Enjoy! Happy Coding!

REFERENCE </p>
<code>
strtolower()
Converts Chosen String to all Lower Case

int
A number that is either a negative integer or positive integer.
NOTE: Ints ARE NOT Strings
